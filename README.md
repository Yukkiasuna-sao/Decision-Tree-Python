# Decision Tree in Python

In this repo, I have developed binary decision tree from scratch using Python. 

*Everything has been developed from scratch. No packages have been used to buid decision tree.*

1. Implemented the **decision tree** of given depth size.
2. Implemented performance matrix calculation for each depth 

## Limitation
1. It will work when all the attributes are categorical
2. It will work for Binary classifier only
